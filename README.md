# PlayOnLinux-MSOffice2007
An installation script for installing MS Word 2007 on Linux with PlayOnLinux

See [The Microsoft Office 2007
page](https://www.playonlinux.com/en/app-436-Microsoft_Office_2007.html) for
[Play On Linux](https://www.playonlinux.com/en/) for more details.

To use this script, open play on linux 4.2.12, Tools/Run a local script and
select msoffice.sh from this folder.

It should:

* Install MS Office 2007 also on Ubuntu 18.04 (which the original official
  version doesn't).
* Install .desktop files that integrate with the installed applications list
  and right-click/properties so e.g. .doc(x) files can be opened with MS Word
  without too much hassle.
* Copy in the required fonts for word, so that smilies and bullet lists work
  out of the box.
